    This report investigates the time complexity of the Shellsort algorithm , based on both empirical measurements and formal analysis, with a particular focus on key arrangements that lead to worst-case behavior.

    Using a classic increment sequence of the form $h_t = \lfloor \frac{n}{2^t} \rfloor$, we analyze the number of element comparisons and swaps during the sorting process.
    Depending on the choice of increment sequence, the average-case complexity ranges between $O(n \log n)$ and $O(n^{1.5})$, while worst-case scenarios can yield a theoretical upper bound of $O(n^2)$.
    The report includes code-level analysis and visual illustrations that highlight the algorithmâ€™s operational steps, especially under worst-case conditions.
