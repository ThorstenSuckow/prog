\section{conclusion}

The findings indicate clearly that the performance evaluation of sorting algorithms should not rely solely on empirical analyses using randomly generated arrays, even though such tests might initially reflect realistic scenarios.
Algorithms such as Shellsort can demonstrate surprising worst-case behaviors for specific input sequences, potentially causing severe performance issues in critical, real-time applications.
Consequently, rigorous theoretical analysis of algorithmic behavior remains a crucial practice for computer scientists and mathematicians, complementing empirical methods and providing substantial benefits for algorithmic reliability in practical use.
